## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Diving into this project, I've sharpened my skills with CSS Grid, which has been a game-changer for designing responsive gallery sections. CSS Grid's flexibility in handling layout adjustments helped me ensure everything stayed proportionate and tidy, enhancing the overall user experience.

Hereâ€™s a quick example:


```css
  .gallery-bottom {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(8, minmax(0, 1fr));
    margin-top: 2rem;
    gap: 2rem;
  }
```
